# Descriptive-Analysis-using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning

This task is about finding and evaluating clusters that contain data with similar properties.

We will discover some new places here in Sweden that may be suitable for IKEA department stores. We will do this by using the k-means method. We have a text file, ikea_kommun_data.txt, which contains essential features for many of Sweden’s municipalities to aid you in your findings. The English term municipality translated to Swedish is kommun.

IKEA stores are already available in the following municipalities: Borlänge, Gävle, Göteborg, Haparanda, Helsingborg, Jönköping, Kalmar, Karlstad, Linköping, Malmö, Stockholm, Sundsvall, Uddevalla, Umeå, Uppsala, Västerås, Älmhult, and Örebro. Some of these municipalities are missing in the ikea_data.txt file. The following link shows a map of Sweden's municipalities, https://www.scb.se/contentassets/1e02934987424259b730c5e9a82f7e74/kommunkarta09.pdf

The general steps are data exploration, data transformation, data reduction, and the kmeans clustering method.

Main Python libraries to use:

• scikit-learn (a Python library that features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms) https://scikit- learn.org/stable/

• pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/

• NumPy https://numpy.org/
